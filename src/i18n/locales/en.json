    "section3Card4Text": "There's never enough time in the day to cover every patient, and increasing touchpoints is something you want to do, but not at the expense of your staff. The last thing you or they want to do is spend more time on technology. Optimize Health's RPM program includes user-friendly software that syncs data from connected devices to patient records. Our clinical team is an extension of your staff, escalating only those who need you now. 1%-2% of Optimize Health alerts require escalation to your clinical team. It streamlines workflows, ensures patients get the attention they need, and decreases your clinical staff's workload.",
    "section3Card5Heading": "Increase revenue with an RPM program.",
    "section3Card5Text": "Remote patient monitoring supports fee-for-service and value-based care incentives. RPM programs can improve the quality of care through outcomes like reduced hospitalization, readmission, and HbA1c numbers. Our platform includes clinical and billing workflows, as well as support in dealing with private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid.",
    "faqTitle": "FAQs about remote patient monitoring",
    "accordion": {
      "q1": "How do RPM programs engage with patients with chronic diseases outside the office?",
      "a1": "Engagement with patients begins when they are regularly using their connected devices and taking vital readings. Now, they're participating in their health. The next layer involves 1:1 engagement with the clinical monitoring team. These licensed and experienced nurses have regular contact and touchpoints with patients to remind them to use their devices and take their medications. Patients can also ask nurses questions and speak to the same one most days, building trust.",
      "q2": "How does our RPM platform reduce strains and constraints on staff?",
      "a2": "You can operate a robust RPM program without adding staff or overburdening them. With our care experts able to resolve about 95% of the alerts, your team can get the help they need quickly and efficiently. You can optimize staff time by having the right data at the right time.",
      "q3": "How does remote patient monitoring technology reduce emergency care?",
      "a3": "By monitoring patients remotely, you can access real-time data revealing any fluctuations in their vitals. If they reach a threshold, you receive immediate alerts to intervene before the need arises for emergency department visits or hospitalization. Over time, you'll also have more data to demonstrate whether the current treatment is working."
